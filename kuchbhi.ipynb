Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, State President Madan Rathore, State In-Charge Radhamohan Das Aggarwal, and State Co-In-Charge Vijaya Rahatkar will represent Rajasthan at the meeting, while Union Ministers Bhupendra Yadav and Satish Poonia will participate via video conference.\\n\\nAccording to sources, the Rajasthan BJP has shortlisted three names for each of the seven assembly seats. After careful deliberation in the core committee meeting, the candidates have been finalised. It was also decided that the final names would be selected through collective agreement. Additionally, the committee resolved to take the government's 10-month achievements and election preparations to the public.\\n\\nThe by-elections will be held in the following constituencies: Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Deoli-Uniyara, Chaurasi, Khinvsar, Salumbar, and Ramgarh. These seats fell vacant after their respective MLAs won in the Lok Sabha elections, except Salumbar and Ramgarh, which were vacated due to the deaths of BJP MLA Amritlal Meena and Congress MLA Zuber Khan, respectively.\\n\\nThe upcoming by-elections are expected to be a significant test of strength for the state BJP, as they navigate internal rifts and external challenges in the lead-up to the polls.\",\n",
